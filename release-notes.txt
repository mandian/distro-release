   The OpenMandriva Lx teams are pleased to announce the availability of
   OpenMandriva Lx 3.03!

   Detailed below are some of the advances that the distribution has
   incorporated since OpenMandriva Lx 3.02.

Install

Available Media

   This release is available as a live media DVD, downloadable in ISO
   format. These are available on our [73]downloads page.

   Live media means you are able to run OpenMandriva Lx straight from a
   DVD or memory stick (see below) and try it before installing it. You
   may also install the system to hard disk either from the running live
   image or from the boot manager.

Recommended Hardware

   OpenMandriva Lx 3.03 requires at least 2.0 GB of memory (min 1.5 GB),
   at least 10 GB of hard drive space (see below for known issues with
   partitioning).

   If you wish to run the live distribution (the option to Start
   OpenMandriva Lx at the DVD boot screen), you must have at minimum 1.5
   GB of memory. At least 2 GB of memory is recommended for optimal
   performance.

   Release is available for x86_64 architecture, the i586 and ARM
   architectures are being worked on, but are not yet available for this
   release.

   Important Note: Font Rendering Currently font rendering is poor in some
   applications (om-welcome, firefox, Thunderbird and Chromium-Browser)
   Please see Errata for a workaround. Updated applications are or will be
   available from our repos.

   Important Note: Graphics Hardware

   The KDE Plasma Desktop requires a 3D graphics card that supports OpenGL
   2.0 or above.

Internet Connection

   Currently the Calamares Installer requires an Internet connection, but
   OpenMandriva Lx 3 will install just fine even without an Internet
   connection. It is perfectly OK to simply install as you normally would
   and proceed to use your new system as normal.

   The install module 'packages' is what requires Internet, it does two
   things which can easily be done after the installation. These steps are
   optional if the user wishes to do so. First boot in to your new system
   then in Konsole or other terminal run as root:

   1. # urpmi.update -a

   which simply updates the urpmi repositories.

   2. # urpme calamares console-setup drakx-finish-install
   drakx-installer-matchbox squashfs-tools

   which simply removes 5 packages used only during the installation
   process.

Virtual Machines

   The same hardware requirements apply when running in virtual machines.

   For VirtualBox, however, you must ALWAYS have at least 1536 MB of
   memory or OpenMandriva Lx will fail to boot. Please ensure that
   VirtualBox is configured with "Enable PAE/NX", this option can be found
   under the System > Processor tab.
   Also for VirtualBox it is advisable to install to a fresh VM, as trying
   to install to an existing one may occasionally fail.

   Note that if you use qemu, you may need to select an alternative
   graphics driver other than your distribution default or you will boot
   to a black screen.

Installer and EFI Support

   This release of OpenMandriva Lx supports booting and installation with
   and without [74]UEFI.

   Best system installation experience is provided by [75]Calamares 3.1.8
   installer.

What is Calamares ?

   Calamares is an installer framework. By design it is very customizable,
   in order to satisfy a wide variety of needs and use cases. Calamares
   aims to be easy, usable, beautiful, pragmatic, inclusive and
   distribution-agnostic. Calamares includes an advanced partitioning
   feature, with support for both manual and automated partitioning
   operations. It is the first installer with an automated “Replace
   Partition” option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and
   over for distribution testing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   You should be able to boot and install OpenMandriva Lx on [76]UEFI
   machines.

   Note that secure boot is NOT supported.

   If you are installing beside Windows 8, 8.1, 10 or similar EFI booted
   OS as a precaution please ensure that you have recovery disks and you
   have backed up any important data. Our testing has been limited with
   this configuration, but successful installations have been performed
   with no issues. We would welcome any feedback in this area.

   Please see the notes on partitioning [77]here and [78]here.

EFI Partitioning

   If you wish to perform an EFI installation on an existing MBR disk it
   will be necessary to convert the disk partition table to the newer GPT
   partitioning scheme. To do this you need to use the gdisk tool. A
   typical invocation would be 'gdisk /dev/sda': the existing partition
   table will be converted in memory to the GPT scheme. Warnings will be
   issued about potential data loss, the disk will not be altered until
   you write the partition table by pressing "w". You are advised to back
   up any important data.

   There may be occasions where the conversion cannot be performed, this
   will usually be due to insufficient space at the beginning or end of
   the disk to write the partition table. It may be necessary to delete or
   resize a partition to create the needed space, gparted is your friend
   in these circumstances.

   There is still a need to create an efi partition to contain the boot
   equipment and this must be created while running the Calamares
   installer. When the installer reaches the partitioning stage the /
   (root) partition should be removed and a small (330 MB) FAT32 partition
   created at the start of the drive. If diskspace is critical then a
   smaller partition may be used, but be sure to set it as FAT16 in
   Calamares otherwise the installation will fail. If you fail to observe
   these steps the installation of the boot loader will fail. Subsequently
   partition the disk in the normal way. Please share your experiences on
   the forums so that we may improve this aspect of the installation.

Changing Partition Type

   Please note that Calamares cannot convert one partiton type to another
   and preserve partition data. If you run Calamares from the live image
   it is not possible to change an existing partition type. Trying to do
   this generates an error message. In order to do this you must first
   delete the partition and recreate it as the type that you wish. If
   Calamares is run in the "install mode" (the second entry on the boot
   menu) it is possible to simply change the partition type without the
   need to delete.

Booting from USB

   It is also possible to boot this release from an USB storage device. To
   transfer the live/installation image you may use the ROSA Image Writer
   available from our repos.
   Please do not use other usb-writing tools as some Windows tools (e.g.
   Rufus) truncate the volume name. This breaks the boot process.
urpmi rosa-imagewriter

   Or, if you do not have OpenMandriva Lx yet, you can get ROSA Image
   Writer download links at this page
   [79]http://wiki.rosalab.ru/en/index.php/ROSA_ImageWriter

   At least 2 GB of flash drive capacity is recommended. Persistent
   storage is not necessary. Note that this will erase everything on your
   USB!

via dd

   You may alternatively dd the image to your USB stick:
dd if=<iso_name> of=<usb_drive> bs=4M

   Replace <iso_name> with the path to the ISO and <usb_drive> with the
   device node of the USB drive, i.e. /dev/sdb.

Booting from ISO file

   Grub2 entry ( to be added in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg)
submenu "OpenMandriva (64 bit)" {
        set isofile=/home/user/OpenMandrivaLx.3.03-PLASMA.x86_64.iso
        set isoname=OpenMandrivaLx_3.0
        loopback loop $isofile

        menuentry "OpenMandriva" {
                linux (loop)/boot/vmlinuz0 root=live:LABEL=${isoname} iso-scan/f
ilename=${isofile} rd.live.image toram --
                initrd (loop)/boot/liveinitrd.img
        }

}

New Features and Major Changes

   OpenMandriva Lx 3.03 is a new release.

LLVM/clang

   OpenMandriva provides LLVM/clang 5.0.0 as the default compiler, GCC is
   also available. Over 90% of packages in our main repository are now
   built with LLVM/clang.

   Benefits for end user:
     * Faster compiles and Low Memory Use
     * Expressive Diagnostics
     * GCC Compatibility
     * Better object code generation compared to others
     * Object code is optimized for its size
     * OpenMP support enabled by default

   More information can be found [80]here.

Kernel

   OpenMandriva Lx uses the latest stable kernel, 4.13.12, by default BFQ
   is set up as a default I/O scheduler to achieve best performance.
   By default an [81]UKSM is enabled to manage memory efficiently.

systemd

   Default init system is [82]systemd with version 234. By default are
   enabled:
     * systemd-networkd
     * systemd-timedated
     * systemd-timesyncd
     * systemd-resolved

Xorg

   We have upgraded Xorg to version 1.19.5, and Mesa to 17.2.3, which
   brings the latest free drivers for the best performance. A Compose
   cache is now incorporated which speeds up application startup time and
   reduces memory usage especially in locales with large Compose tables
   (e.g. all UTF-8 locales).

   We are using modesetting driver by default for nVIDIA, intel and AMD
   graphics cards.

   With end of 02 October 2017 a S3TC patent has expired, and we have
   included S3TC texture compression in our Mesa.

Wayland

   We are working on many new and interesting shells using new display
   technology based on [83]Wayland 1.14.0 version.

   For now Weston and KDE Plasma 5 are working out of box. KDE Plasma 5
   running on wayland is still experimental and not recommended for daily
   use.

libinput

   All the input devices like keyboard, mouse, touchpad and others are now
   handled though [84]libinput 1.9.2 version library by default.

Desktop

   The oma-welcome or Welcome to OpenMandriva Lx has been updated to
   reflect the new version. This application introduces the users to
   OpenMandriva Lx and shows them some of the features we have, as well as
   providing quick links to common tasks such as updating, installing new
   software, and configuring the desktop.

KDE Plasma 5.10.5

   We have upgraded to the latest and greatest version of the KDE Plasma
   desktop. If you don't know what KDE Plasma is, [85]learn more at their
   website.
   KDE Frameworks are updated to [86]5.39.0 version.
   KDE Applications are updated to [87]17.04.0 version.
   We are using Plasma-discover as a main tool for updating distibution.
   Plasma-discover is a Qt5 frontend for PackageKit.
   Our distribution is running with Qt [88]5.8.0 version.
   Important notice!
   Plasma 5 make heavy use of Qt5 OpenGL. This means that the minimal
   system requirement is to have a graphics card that can support OpenGL
   2.0 or newer version.

KF 5.39.0

   We have implemented full KDE Framework that allows user to get all of
   benefits of Plasma 5 desktop.

Calligra Suite 3.0.0

   [89]Calligra Suite is a graphic art and office suite written in Qt4 and
   supports KDE Plasma 5. (A port to Qt5 is currently in progress, but not
   yet included in the 3.0 release). It is possible to install whole
   calligra suite after installation is finished.

Krita 3.3.1

   [90]Krita is a creative sketching and painting application. It was part
   of Calligra up to version 2.9 and became a project independent from
   Calligra since then. It has already been ported to Qt5 and is included
   in the install image.

SDDM

   SDDM is a new and lightweight displaymanager written in Qt5 with QML
   and provides new features and benefits to enduser compared to KDM.

LXQt 0.11.0

   We have prepared LXQt for our Release. LXQt is a lightweight desktop
   fully written in Qt5.

   By default SDDM is used as display manager.

   bug fixes.

Web browsing

Qupzilla 2.2.1

   [92]Qupzilla is a full featured web browser using Qt5WebEngine as a
   rendering engine. More information can be found [93]here.

   We encourage you to give qupzilla a try as a new experience in the web
   browsers world.

Firefox Quantum 57.0

   The latest [94]Firefox Quantum with its new graphical interface and all
   the latest features.

   You may wish to suspend desktop effects when running Firefox is in full
   screen mode, as it speeds up scrolling.

Chromium 61.0.3163.100

   A [95]Chromium web browser is available to install it on running system
   either by using urpmi, discover or rpmdrake.
urpmi chromium-browser-stable

   If you wish to try an experimental version with newer features (but not
   quite the stability), you can also try
urpmi chromium-browser-dev

   The -stable and -dev versions can coexist on the same installation.

Java 8

   The OpenMandriva Lx Java stack has been entirely rebuilt to version 8
   and is completely functional.

   We currently provide Eclipse MYLYN by default.

Printing

   Improved support for printing, with an emphasis on the latest HP
   printers. Printing support is based on [96]Cups 2.1.3 and ghostscript
   9.19.

Sound

   [97]ALSA is updated to version 1.1.5

   Pulseaudio version is 11.1, you can find more information about
   features [98]here.

Multimedia

   The [99]SMPlayer media player is now included, using [100]MPV as its
   default backend. If you live in a country that allows it, you may want
   to install the various codecs from the restricted repository for
   improved codec support.

   We have enabled [101]LAME support by default. With 2017 start all the
   patents related to [102]MP3 are over. By default our gstreamer, ffmpeg
   and other media frameworks now supports LAME.

libarchive

   We have decided to make better use of [103]libarchive, and starting
   from this release by default we use:
     * bsdtar as a default tar program
     * bsdcpio as a default cpio program

   Detailed features and benefits can be found [104]here.

Perl

   Perl base package has been updated to 5.20.3 version. All perl related
   software in main repository has been rebuilt to meet new version.

Python

   Python has been updated to 3.4.4 version and starting from now it
   became the default python interpreter over python 2.x.

Virtualization

   We provide support for:
     * qemu
     * docker
     * virtualbox

   You can install and run these out of the box.

Games

   We provide many of the games which have been ported to Linux. By using
   of [105]PlayOnLinux you can play games usually available only on the
   Windows(tm) platform. Of course [106]Steam package is also available
   and can be installed using urpmi, rpmdrake or plasma-discover.

   To give it a go, enable the non-free repositories, and
urpmi steam

   More information can be found on our page dedicated to [107]games.

ISO build tools

   Previously livecd-tools were used to build OpenMandriva ISO images. Due
   to code complication and its limits, we moved to build own ISO image
   build tool.

   [108]omdv-build-iso is written as a bash shell script, which works out
   of box on [109]ABF and in userland.

Upgrading from previous OpenMandriva Lx 3.0 Releases

   Upgrade is simple, just check your discover, or rpmdrake for new
   packages and install them. You can also run this command from your
   root:
urpmi --auto-update

Upgrading from OpenMandriva Lx 2014.x and older

   Currently for OpenMandriva Lx 2014.x and older a fresh install is
   recommended.

Changes to Hardware Support

Graphics Support

   Graphics support has improved with the latest drivers. We managed to
   reduce issues by using by default DRM subsystem and modesetting driver
   for AMD, intel and nVIDIA graphics cards.

   To access XFDrake, the DrakX video configuration tool go to Configure
   your Computer>Hardware>Set up the graphical server.

NVIDIA Graphics Cards

   This release includes the reverse engineered nouveau driver, which
   gives moderately good support for most NVIDIA cards. For some
   dual-screen work it is actually better than NVIDIA's binary driver as
   it supports screen rotation on a second monitor, which is useful for
   monitors with rotatable screens.

   NVIDIA's binary drivers (which provide better performance and better
   support for the very latest NVIDIA GPUs) are currently supported by the
   XFDrake, the DrakX video configuration tool. In some cases it may be
   necessary to install older drivers using the command line. These
   drivers are available from the OpenMandriva repositories.

ATI Graphics Cards

   The latest ATI graphics cards are supported; however, we have not had
   any concrete feedback about its usage. Your mileage may vary.

   If you are using Radeon HD7770 or if you experience a black screen at
   boot and you know that you have an ATI/AMD grahics card please add the
   command below to the grub2 cmdline:
xorg.blacklist=ati

   To do this at when booting the iso press the "TAB" key; the kernel
   bootline will be displayed at the bottom of the screen, go to the end
   of it and add any options required there. Press Enter to boot. If you
   need to enter a kernel parameter while booting an installed system the
   procedure is slightly different. At the boot screen press the "E" key
   and this will bring up the Grub editor. Search for the first line that
   begins with "linux" go to the end of it and add the option there. To
   boot press F10.

Intel Graphics Chips

   Intel graphics chips are fully supported.

Miscellaneous Graphic Cards

   We have not had feedback from users. Should you have an unusual
   graphics card that is not performing as it should please file a bug at
   [110]issues.openmandriva.org.

Laptops with dual graphics cards

   If you have a laptop with dual graphics cards you may get a black
   ecreen at boot this is due to the kernel loading the drm module for the
   graphics card that is not active to the laptop screen. On some laptops
   it is possible to switch screensby the use of a physical switch if you
   have a switch then try the other setting it may work. If it does not
   you will need to add some commands to the kernel boot line. The
   following commands can be used to completely blacklist nvidia graphics
   and allow booting with the Intel graphics hardware.
   "rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau" Prevents the loading of the kernel driver
   in the initrd thus allowing the intel i915 module to load.
   "xorg.blacklist=nouveau" Prevent's the xorg nouveau driver from loading
   which would again try to install the nouveau kernel module.

   If you have AMD/ATI graphics you should use ati or radeon in place of
   nouveau

   To do this at when booting the iso press the "TAB" key; the kernel
   bootline will be displayed at the bottom of the screen, go to the end
   of it and add any options required there. Press Enter to boot. If you
   need to enter a kernel parameter while booting an installed system the
   procedure is slightly different. At the boot screen press the "E" key
   and this will bring up the Grub editor. Search for the first line that
   begins with "linux" go to the end of it and add the options there. To
   boot press F10.

   In the case of nVidia hardware once you have booted you will be able to
   install their proprietry drivers using drakx. Some uses have reported
   success installing bumblebee to enable switching between the two
   graphics environments. Please come to our [111]forums and discuss your
   experience with these laptops as we are anxious to improve support.

Changes to Installation

Installer

   We are using [112]Calamares as our default installer.

   Calamares is an installer framework. By design it is very customizable,
   in order to satisfy a wide variety of needs and use cases.

   Calamares aims to be easy, usable, beautiful, pragmatic, inclusive and
   distribution-agnostic.

Unused Hardware & Language Removal

   This feature has been re-enabled. It prompts you to run it at first
   boot, and you may run it any time afterwards from the oma-welcome
   application (Welcome to OpenMandriva Lx).

Changes to the DrakX suite of tools

Boot Configuration

   We now default to using grub2-editor to control the boot loader.

Proprietary Drivers

   We now install proprietary drivers for nVIDIA and AMD correctly.

Firewall

   We have deprecated drakfirewall in favour of firewall-config, which
   relies on firewalld.

   The service responsible for starting the firewall is enabled by
   default.

Booting with systemd

   Systemd has now been moved into the initramfs and the result is
   super-fast booting. Switching runlevels has changed. Instead of adding
   the target runlevel, as before, there are now specific boot options.
   Namely, the following options must be appended to the kernel command
   line:
     * Rescue Mode: systemd.unit=rescue.target
     * Text Mode: systemd.unit=multi-user.target
     * Graphical Mode: systemd.unit=graphical.target

Desktop Environments

   This release offers KDE Plasma 5 and LXQt as desktop environments.

Media Sources

     * main

   main is the core packages maintained by the OpenMandriva Lx team. This
   includes anything included in the install images as well as many more
   applications considered important.
     * contrib

   contrib represents community maintained packages. These are not
   supported by the core OpenMandriva Lx team, and depend on package
   maintainers to update it.
     * restricted

   restricted contains libraries that aren't installed by default due to
   legal concerns (such as patent issues). The usage of these packages
   vary by country - OpenMandriva Lx is not responsible for their usage!
   If you believe that their usage is disallowed in your country, please
   disable the restricted repositories.
     * non-free

   non-free contains applications and drivers that are distributable, but
   do not meet the definitions of [113]Free Software. While we can adjust
   the packaging of such applications, we do not have the source code and
   therefore can not fix problems caused by anything in this repository.

Helping the Project

   The OpenMandriva development teams (Cooker & QA) are always looking for
   new contributors to assist in creating and maintaining packages and to
   assist bugfixing and testing. You are welcome to join us and help us in
   this work which is not only rewarding but also tremendous fun!

   If you feel that your talents do not lie in the realm of software, then
   the OpenMandriva Workshop group, which is made up from the artwork,
   documentation, translation and Communication teams, is always open for
   the submissions of artwork and translations. New contributors who would
   like to help with these wide-ranging tasks should see the wiki for more
   details, and to learn how to join! Alternatively you may use our
   [114]Forum.

   It also costs time and money to keep our servers up and running. If you
   can, please [115]donate to keep the lights on!
