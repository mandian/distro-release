   The OpenMandriva Lx teams are pleased to announce the availability of
   OpenMandriva Lx 3.02!

   Detailed below are some of the advances that the distribution has
   incorporated since OpenMandriva Lx 3.01.

Available Media

   This release is available as a live media DVD, downloadable in ISO
   format. These are available on our [75]downloads page.

   Live media means you are able to run OpenMandriva Lx straight from a
   DVD or memory stick (See Below) and try it before installing it. You
   may also install the system to hard disk either from the running live
   image or from the boot manager.

Recommended Hardware

   OpenMandriva Lx 3.02 requires at least 2.0 GB of memory (min 1,5GB), at
   least 10 GB of hard drive space (see below for known issues with
   partitioning).

   If you wish to run the live distribution (the option to Start
   OpenMandriva Lx at the CD boot screen), you must have at minimum 1.5 GB
   of memory. At least 2 GB of memory is recommended for optimal
   performance.

   Release is available for x86_64 architecture, The i586 and ARM
   architectures are being worked on, but are not yet available for this
   release.

   Important Note

   The KDE Plasma Desktop requires a 3D graphics card that supports OpenGL
   2.0 or above

Virtual Machines

   The same hardware requirements apply when running in virtual machines.

   For VirtualBox, however, you must ALWAYS have at least 1536 MB of
   memory or OpenMandriva Lx will fail to boot. Please ensure that
   VirtualBox is configured with "Enable PAE/NX" This option can be found
   under the System>Processor tab.
   Also for VirtualBox you must install to a fresh VM, as trying to
   install to an existing one may fail. This recent problem is being
   investigated.

   Note that if you use qemu, you may need to select an alternative
   graphics driver other than your distribution default or you will boot
   to a black screen.

Installer and EFI Support

   This release of OpenMandriva Lx supports booting and installation with
   and without [76]UEFI.

   Best system installation experience is provided by [77]Calamares 3.1
   installer.

What is Calamares ?

   Calamares is an installer framework. By design it is very customizable,
   in order to satisfy a wide variety of needs and use cases. Calamares
   aims to be easy, usable, beautiful, pragmatic, inclusive and
   distribution-agnostic. Calamares includes an advanced partitioning
   feature, with support for both manual and automated partitioning
   operations. It is the first installer with an automated “Replace
   Partition” option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and
   over for distribution testing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   You should be able to boot and install OpenMandriva LX on [78]UEFI
   machines.

   Note that secure boot is NOT supported.

   If you are installing beside Windows8, 8.1, 10 or similar EFI booted OS
   as a precaution please ensure that you have recovery disks and you have
   backed up any important data. Our testing has been limited with this
   configuration but successful installs have been performed with no
   issues. We would welcome any feedback in this area.

   Please see the notes on partitioning [79]here and [80]here

EFI Partitioning

   If you wish to to perform an EFI install on an existing MBR disk it
   will be necessary to convert the disks partition table to the newer GPT
   partitioning scheme. To do this you need to use the gdisk tool. A
   typical invocation would be 'gdisk /dev/sda'; the existing partition
   table will be converted in memory to the GPT scheme. Warnings will be
   issued about potential data loss, the disk will not be altered until
   you write the partition table by pressing "w". You are advised to back
   up any important data.

   There may be occasions where the conversion cannot be performed, this
   will usually be due to insufficient space at the beginning or end of
   the disk to write the partition tables. It may be necessary to delete
   or resize a partition to create the needed space. gparted is your
   friend in these circumstances.

   There is still a need to create an efi partition to contain the boot
   equipment and this must be created while running the Calamares
   installer. When the installer reaches the partitioning stage the /
   (root) partition should be removed and a small (330mB) FAT32 partition
   created at the start of the drive. If diskspace is critical then a
   smaller partition may be used but be sure to set it as FAT16 in
   Calamares otherwise the install will fail. If you fail to observe these
   steps installation of the boot loader will fail. Subsequently partition
   the disk in the normal way. Please share your experiences on the forums
   so that we may improve this aspect of the installation.

Booting from USB

   It is also possible to boot this release from a USB storage device. To
   transfer the live/installation you may use the ROSA Image Writer
   available from our repos.
   Please do not use other usb-writing tools as some Windows tools (e.g.
   Rufus) truncate the volume name. This breaks the boot process.
urpmi rosa-imagewriter

   Or, if you do not have OpenMandriva Lx yet, you can get ROSA Image
   Writer download links at this page
   [81]http://wiki.rosalab.ru/en/index.php/ROSA_ImageWriter

   At least 2GB of flash drive capacity is recommended. Persistent storage
   is not necessary. Note that this will erase everything on your USB!

via dd

   You may alternatively dd the image to your USB stick:
dd if=<iso_name> of=<usb_drive> bs=4M

   Replace <iso_name> with the path to the ISO and <usb_drive> with the
   device node of the USB drive, i.e. /dev/sdb.

Booting from ISO file

   Grub2 entry ( to be added in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg)
submenu "OpenMandriva (64 bit)" {
        set isofile=/home/user/OpenMandrivaLx.3.0-PLASMA.x86_64.iso
        set isoname=OpenMandrivaLx_3.0
        loopback loop $isofile

        menuentry "OpenMandriva" {
                linux (loop)/boot/vmlinuz0 root=live:LABEL=${isoname} iso-scan/f
ilename=${isofile} rd.live.image toram --
                initrd (loop)/boot/liveinitrd.img
        }

}

New Features and Major Changes

   OpenMandriva Lx 3.02 is a new release.

LLVM/clang

   OpenMandriva decided to give a go for a switch to LLVM/clang 4.0.1 as
   the default compiler, and finally has replaced GCC. Over 90% of
   packages in our main repository are built with LLVM/clang.

   Benefits for end user:
     * Fast compiles and Low Memory Use
     * Expressive Diagnostics
     * GCC Compatibility
     * Better object code generation compared to others
     * Object code is optimized for its size
     * OpenMP support enabled by default

   More information can be found [82]here.

Kernel

   OpenMandriva Lx uses the latest stable kernel, 4.11.1, by default with
   [83]BFQ set up as a default I/O scheduler to achieve best performance.
   By default an [84]UKSM is enabled to manage memory efficiently

   Please, see: [85]https://wiki.openmandriva.org/en/Kernel for more
   information.

systemd

   Default init system is [86]systemd with version 233. By default are
   enabled:
     * systemd-networkd
     * systemd-timedated
     * systemd-timesyncd
     * systemd-resolved

Xorg

   We have upgraded Xorg to version 1.19.3, and Mesa to 17.1.0, which
   brings the latest free drivers for the best performance. A Compose
   cache is now incorporated which speeds up application startup time and
   reduces memory usage especially in locales with large Compose tables
   (e.g. all UTF-8 locales).

   We are using modesetting driver by default for nVIDIA, intel and AMD
   graphics cards.

Wayland

   We are working on many new and interesting shells using new display
   technology based on [87]Wayland 1.12.0 version.

   For now Weston and KDE Plasma 5 are working out of box. KDE Plasma 5
   running on wayland is still experimental and not recommended for daily
   use.

libinput

   All the input devices like keyboard, mouse, touchpad and others are now
   handled though [88]libinput 1.6.3 version library by default.

Desktop

   The oma-welcome, or Welcome to OpenMandriva Lx has been updated to
   reflect the new version. This application introduces users to
   OpenMandriva Lx and shows them some of the features we have, as well as
   providing quick links to common tasks such as updating, installing new
   software, and configuring a desktop.

KDE Plasma 5.9.5

   We have ve upgraded to the latest and greatest version of the KDE
   Plasma desktop. If you don't know what KDE Plasma is, [89]learn more at
   their website.
   KDE Frameworks are updated to [90]5.33.0 version.
   KDE Applications are updated to [91]17.04.0 version.
   We are using Plasma-discover as a main tool for updating distibution.
   Plasma-discover is a Qt5 frontend for PackageKit.
   Our distribution is running with Qt [92]5.8.0 version.
   Important notice!
   Plasma 5 make heavy use of Qt5 OpenGL. This means that the minimal
   system requirement is to have a graphics card that can support OpenGL
   2.0 or newer version.

KF 5.33.0

   We have implemented full KDE Framework that allows user to get all of
   benefits of Plasma 5 desktop.

Calligra Suite 3.0.0

   [93]Calligra Suite is a graphic art and office suite written in Qt4 and
   supports KDE Plasma 5. (A port to Qt5 is currently in progress, but not
   yet included in the 3.0 release). It is possible to install whole
   calligra suite after installation is finished.

Krita 3.1.3

   [94]Krita is a creative sketching and painting application. It was part
   of Calligra up to version 2.9 and became a project independent from
   Calligra since then. It has already been ported to Qt5 and is included
   in the install image.

SDDM

   SDDM is new and lightweight displaymanager, written in Qt5 with QML and
   provides new features and benefits to enduser, compared to KDM.

LXQt 0.11.0

   We have prepared LXQt for our Release. LXQt is a lightweight desktop
   fully written in Qt5.

   By default SDDM is used as display manager.

xfce4 4.12.0

   xfce4 is very lightweight environment based on GTK+2.0 and GTK+3.0,
   featuring speed, low request on resources combined with great look.

LibreOffice 5.3.3

   The latest [95]LibreOffice featuring much faster load times and many
   bug fixes.

Web browsing

Qupzilla 2.1.2

   [96]Qupzilla is a full featured web browser using Qt5WebEngine as a
   rendering engine. More information can be found [97]here.

   We encourage you to give qupzilla a try as a new experience in the web
   browsers world.

Firefox 53.0.2

   The latest [98]firefox with its new graphical interface and all the
   latest features.

   You may wish to suspend desktop effects when running Firefox is in full
   screen mode, as it speeds up scrolling.

Chromium 58.0.3029.110

   A [99]Chromium web browser is available to install it on running system
   either by using urpmi, discover or rpmdrake.
urpmi chromium-browser-stable

   If you wish to try an experimental version with newer features (but not
   quite the stability), you can also try
urpmi chromium-browser-dev

   The -stable and -dev versions can coexist on the same installation.

Java 8

   The OpenMandriva Java stack has been entirely rebuilt to version 8 and
   is completely functional.

   We currently provide Eclipse Luna by default.

Printing

   Improved support for printing, with an emphasis on the latest HP
   printers. Printing support is based on [100]Cups 2.1.3 and ghostscript
   9.19.

Sound

   [101]ALSA is updated to version 1.1.4

   Pulseaudio version is 10.0, you can find more information about
   features [102]here.

Multimedia

   The [103]SMPlayer media player is now included, using [104]MPV as its
   default backend. If you live in a country that allows it, you may want
   to install the various codecs from the restricted repository for
   improved codec support.

   We have enabled [105]LAME support by default. With 2017 start all the
   patents related to [106]MP3 are over. By default our gstreamer, ffmpeg
   and other media frameworks now supports LAME.

libarchive

   We have decided to make better use of [107]libarchive, and starting
   from this release by default we use:
     * bsdtar as a default tar program
     * bsdcpio as a default cpio program

   Detailed features and benefits can be found [108]here.

Perl

   Perl base package has been updated to 5.20.3 version. All perl related
   software in main repository has been rebuilt to meet new version.

Python

   Python has been updated to 3.4.4 version and starting from now it
   became default python interpreter over python 2.x.

Virtualization

   We provide support for:
     * qemu
     * docker
     * virtualbox

   You can install and run these out of the box.

Games

   We provide many of the games which have been ported to Linux. By using
   of [109]PlayOnLinux you can play games usually available only on the
   Windows(tm) platform. Of course [110]Steam package is also available
   and can be installed using urpmi, rpmdrake or plasma-discover.

   To give it a go, enable the non-free repositories, and
urpmi steam

   More information can be found on our page dedicated to [111]games.

ISO build tools

   Previously livecd-tools were used to build OpenMandriva ISO images. Due
   to code complication and its limits, we moved to build own ISO image
   build tool.

   [112]omdv-build-iso is written as a bash shell script, which works out
   of box on [113]ABF and in userland.

Upgrading from previous OpenMandriva Lx 3.0 Releases

   Upgrade is simple, just check your discover, or rpmdrake for new
   packages and install them. You can also run this command from your
   root:
urpmi --auto-update

Upgrading from OpenMandriva Lx 2014.x and older

   Currently for OpenMandriva Lx 2014.x and older a fresh install is
   recommended.

Changes to Hardware Support

Graphics Support

   Graphics support has improved with the latest drivers. We managed to
   reduce issues by using by default DRM subsystem and modesetting driver
   for AMD, intel and nVIDIA graphics cards.

   To access XFDrake, the DrakX video configuration tool go to
   Om-Welcome>Configure>Configure video drivers or go to Configure your
   Computer>Hardware>Set up the graphical server.

NVIDIA Graphics Cards

   This release includes the reverse engineered nouveau driver, which
   gives moderately good support for most NVIDIA cards. For some
   dual-screen work it is actually better than NVIDIA's binary driver as
   it supports screen rotation on a second monitor, which is useful for
   monitors with rotatable screens.

   NVIDIA's binary drivers (which provide better performance and better
   support for the very latest NVIDIA GPUs) are currently supported by the
   XFDrake, the DrakX video configuration tool. In some cases it may be
   necessary to install older drivers using the command line. These
   drivers are available from the OpenMandriva repositories.

ATI Graphics Cards

   The latest ATI graphics cards are supported; however, we have not had
   any concrete feedback about its usage. Your mileage may vary.

   If you are using Radeon HD7770 or if you experience a black screen at
   boot and you know that you have an ATI/AMD grahics card please add the
   command below to the grub2 cmdline:-
xorg.blacklist=ati

   To do this at when booting the iso press the "TAB" key; the kernel
   bootline will be displayed at the bottom of the screen, go to the end
   of it and add any options required there. Press enter to boot. If you
   need to enter a kernel parameter while boot an installed system the
   procedure is slightly different. At the boot screen press the "E" key
   and this will bring up the Grub editor. Search for the first line that
   begins with "linux" go to the end of it and add the option there. To
   boot press F10.

Intel Graphics Chips

   Intel graphics chips are fully supported.

Miscellaneous Graphic Cards

   We have not had feedback from users. Should you have an unusual
   graphics card that is not performing as it should please file a bug at
   issues.openmandriva.org

Laptops with dual graphics cards

   Please report any issues experienced.

Changes to Installation

Installer

   We are using [114]Calamares as our default installer.

   Calamares is an installer framework. By design it is very customizable,
   in order to satisfy a wide variety of needs and use cases.

   Calamares aims to be easy, usable, beautiful, pragmatic, inclusive and
   distribution-agnostic.

Unused Hardware & Language Removal

   This feature has been re-enabled. It prompts you to run it at first
   boot, and you may run it any time afterwards from the oma-welcome
   application (Welcome to OpenMandriva Lx).

Changes to the DrakX suite of tools

Boot Configuration

   We now default to using grub2-editor to control the boot loader.

Proprietary Drivers

   We now install proprietary drivers for nVIDIA and AMD correctly.

Firewall

   We have deprecated drakfirewall in favour of firewall-config, which
   relies on firewalld.

   The service responsible for starting the firewall is enabled by
   default.

Booting with systemd

   Systemd has now been moved into the initramfs and the result is
   super-fast booting. Switching runlevels has changed. Instead of adding
   the target runlevel, as before, there are now specific boot options.
   Namely, the following options must be appended to the kernel command
   line:
     * Rescue Mode: systemd.unit=rescue.target
     * Text Mode: systemd.unit=multi-user.target
     * Graphical Mode: systemd.unit=graphical.target

Desktop Environments

   This release offers KDE Plasma 5, LXQt and xfce4 as desktop
   environments.

Media Sources

main

   main is the core packages maintained by the OpenMandriva Lx team. This
   includes anything included in the install images as well as many more
   applications considered important.

contrib

   contrib represents community maintained packages. These are not
   supported by the core OpenMandriva Lx team, and depend on package
   maintainers to update it.

restricted

   restricted contains libraries that aren't installed by default due to
   legal concerns (such as patent issues). The usage of these packages
   vary by country - OpenMandriva Lx is not responsible for their usage!
   If you believe that their usage is disallowed in your country, please
   disable the restricted repositories.

non-free

   non-free contains applications and drivers that are distributable, but
   do not meet the definitions of [115]Free Software. While we can adjust
   the packaging of such applications, we do not have the source code and
   therefore can not fix problems caused by anything in this repository.

Other Changes
